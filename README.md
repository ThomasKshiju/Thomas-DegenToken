# DegenToken

A decentralized application (DApp) for managing and utilizing the Degen token, a custom ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

DegenToken is an ERC-20 token smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using the Hardhat framework. The token comes with additional functionalities such as minting, burning, and a redemption feature for specific items.

## Features

- **Minting:** The owner of the contract can mint new Degen tokens and distribute them to specific addresses.
- **Burning:** Token holders can burn their own tokens based on a specific item serial number, which grants them access to exclusive items in the redemption shop.
- **Redemption Shop:** The contract has a predefined redemption shop with three items available for redemption: Pant, Shirt, Suit. Users can redeem these items by burning a specific quantity of tokens.
- **Owner Advantage:** The contract provides a function for the owner to burn tokens from a target address, assuming the target address holds more than 5 tokens.
